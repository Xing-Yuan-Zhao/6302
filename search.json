Participants with low vision, reading capability or disabilities may have disadvantages completing the survey, so they may be under represented in the data.\nQuestion 2 5 and 6 may be not mobile friendly depending users’ device.\n\n\n\nFurther assignment:\nThe Diversity and Inclusiveness Survey cannot be found under your library/Qualtrics library.\nBut when compared with the similar questions under Demographics/Demographics, the income and education questions are different.\nFor the income quesiton, the demographic question has a better articulated, because it specified geussing for the previous year’s pre tax income.\nIn the demographic question, the step width of the income question smaller and the range is wider.\nEducation question is not mentioned in the movie survey."

Even though the increase in search trend for Harris was still lower than Trump’s highest number, the impact of the second event (Biden’s dropout) on the difference in the trend was indeed strong."
